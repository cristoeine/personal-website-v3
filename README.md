## Hi everyone!
___
This is my first time coding my portfolio and IT IS LIVE!! (not like my any other portfolio trials). Also I want to thank you to [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com) because I get the inspiration from her.

I built this with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)


## Forking This Repo
**Please read!**
If you guys want to use this code as their own website. I will be open for that. It just that please give me some attribution. 

Why?

Because I spent my time, my effort, many nights just to build this website. Yes, I build it from the beginning like designing my website and then put it in figma and turned it into a website. So please, all you guys need to do just  give me proper credit by linking back to ........ Thanks!

Also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).
